part1_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**
## 1
* A. The Jacobian for a single sample would have the shape $ (512,1024) $. Since we have $N=64$ samples, the Jacobian would have the shape $(64,512,1024)$.
* B.  No, the above Jacobian will not be sparse. This is because: consider a single sample  $x$  and a single sample output $y$. Then $\frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x_j} = W_{ij}$, so the Jacobian is the weight matrix $W$. Since the weight matrix is not sparse, the Jacobian is not sparse as well.
* C. 

## 2

**Your answer:**
The above Jacobian we've described would be mostly sparse,
